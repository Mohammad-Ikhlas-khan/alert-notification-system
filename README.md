The application uses the following seed data for testing and development:

### Teams
- **Engineering Team** (ID: 1)
- **Marketing Team** (ID: 2)

### Users
- **Alice** (ID: 1) - Member of Engineering Team
- **Bob** (ID: 2) - Member of Marketing Team  
- **Charlie** (ID: 3) - Member of Engineering Team

### Code Reference
```java
Team engineering = new Team(1, "Engineering");
Team marketing = new Team(2, "Marketing");

User alice = new User(1, "Alice", engineering.getId());
User bob = new User(2, "Bob", marketing.getId());
User charlie = new User(3, "Charlie", engineering.getId());

this.seedUsers = Arrays.asList(alice, bob, charlie);
```

## üöÄ Extending

- Add new notification channels (EmailChannel, SlackChannel, etc.).

- Hook into real message queues or databases.

- Replace seed data with persistent storage.
